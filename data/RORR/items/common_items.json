        "lore": "Our lab is about finished with this. We agreed that without additional funding, we'd have to ship it back out to complete the project - so here it is. The fields are a bit unstable currently without additional shielding, and the sample you provided was less than ideal, but I would say given the test results we're operating at at least 75% of the efficiency goal. I would recommend that you find a sample with less copper impurities, less than 50 ppm to reach optimal results.",
