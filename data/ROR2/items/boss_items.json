It\u2019s solid, yet swimming.\r\n> Upon structural investigation, found cavities and internal chambers\r\n> Reduce lab temperatures by 10 degrees\r\n> Heat generating veins present - fire is being supplied to the tooth?\r\n> Removed my lab coat, very hot\r\n> Heat generation is still occurring in the severed object\r\n> Put some more ice in my drink WOW it's hot\r\n> Timestamping for break\r\n\""
